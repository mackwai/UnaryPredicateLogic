<h2 id="notepad_plus_plus">Plugin for Notepad++</h2>

<img src="PluginInAction.png" />

<p>I've built the "Decide" and "Depict" functions of the web application into a plugin for Notepad++, which is a fully-featured text editor.  It has some advantages over the web application:</p>

<ul class="bulletted">
  <li>You can use all the features of a text editor when you are working with statements, like editing multiple files at once and finding and replacing text.</li>
  <li>The plugin is much faster.  On my computer, it decides statements about 30 times faster than the web application!</li>
  <li>Once you've installed it, you don't need to be connected to the Internet to use it.</li>
  <li>You can save the depictions of statement graphs as PNG files.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>To use the plugin, the following software must also be installed:

<ul class="bulletted">
  <li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40779" target="_blank">Microsoft .NET 4.5.1</a> or higher.  If you use Windows and Windows Update is enabled, this has probably been installed on your computer automatically.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.graphviz.org/" target="_blank">Graphviz</a>, but only if you want to "depict" statements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>To install the plugin:</p>

<ol class="bulletted">
  <li>Download <a href="Notepad++Plugin.zip">Notepad++Plugin.zip</a>.</li>
  <li>Open the .zip file and copy its contents to NotePad++'s plugins folder (normally <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\plugins</em>).  Windows will ask if you want to merge the "Config" folder.  Choose "Yes".</li>
  <li>If you have Graphviz, add Graphviz' binary folder (e.g. <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.34\bin</em>) to the PATH environment variable.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Use</h3>

<p>Once the plugin has been installed, all you need to do to is start Notepad++.  The plugin's functions should be in the menu under "Plugins &#8594;  Symbolic Logic".</p>

<p>The "Decide" function will also have an icon on the toolbar:</p>
